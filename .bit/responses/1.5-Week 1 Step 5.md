## Week 1 Step 5

### What's the day?

## More practice with Azure Functions

*This week, you will be going through steps to set up tools needed to be successful in this camp. If you are already familiar with some, feel free to skip to the end and complete the task to move on.*

Get started by creating another new HTTP Trigger Azure Function with the already created Function App.

**:pencil: Task 5: Create and deploy an HTTP trigger Azure Function that outputs the day of the week in the specified format below.**

Required output:
```
Happy [day of the week]!
```

If today was Monday, then your function would return `Happy Monday!`.

<summary>:exclamation: How should I test it?</summary>
    </br>

**Option 1:**
Paste the *function url* directly in your browser. Text with the current time should appear.

**Option 2:**
Use **Postman**! Paste the *function url* and make a GET request. In the output box, you should get your desired output:

*Note: This image does not contain the desired output for this task.*

**:camping: To move on, place your function URL in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `SECOND_ENDPOINT` so we can check your function. Remember to commit the function's code in a file named `httpday.js` to the root of the `week1` branch!**

*Note: Every time you make a new commit to `week1`, we will check your function by making a request.*
