## Building a Beard Detector üßî
We are going to be starting the week off by building a beard detector using Microsoft Cognitive Services.

‚úÖ To Move On

- [ ]  Create Face API endpoint 
- [ ]  Create a new Azure Function and add the endpoint to a secret called `FUNCTION_URL`
- [ ]  Install & Use `node-fetch` to send post request to the Face API Endpoint and receive data
- [ ]  Check if the output works with Postman
- [ ]  Commit the change to `week2` branch

## The Face API? 
The [Face API](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aA8OEZ1wk8) takes an image, and returns information about the face, specifically emotions. 

Log into your Azure portal, press **Create a Resource**, the **AI + Machine Learning** tab on the left, and finally select **Face** and fill out the necessary information. Record and save the API endpoint and subscription key.
