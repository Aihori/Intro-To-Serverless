## Week 1 Step 1

### Getting Started

## Learning GitHub

*This week, you will be going through steps to set up tools needed to be successful in this camp. If you are already familiar with some, feel free to skip to the end and complete the task to move on.*

### GitHub

<details>
<summary><b>What is Github?</b></summary>
GitHub is a cloud-based repository hosting service that is widely used in the tech industry. It allows teams to use Git for version control, collaboration, and file management. If you don't know what Git is, it's a version-control system for tracking changes, managing state, and teams concurrently developing on the same files or directories. Git and Github's tools are specifically designed to make coordinating work easier, and they are one of the most popular tools among students and the industry.

TL;DR: You're using it right now. "Issues" are created to suggest improvements, "pull requests" are used to merge your changes to someone else's code, "branches" allow you to make new changes/features without editing your main code, and "commits" are you saving your code to the repository. In case you mess up, GitHub has the old code that works!

<summary>Help! I don't know how to use it and I need more information.</summary>
If you want to learn more about *what it is* and *how to use it*, try taking [this](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) GitHub Learning Lab Course. After finishing it, you will have a strong understanding of all the features GitHub has to offer.
</details>

**One very important rule...**
*Don't* work on your code in the web editor. This is bad practice, and you will regret it later.
<details>
<summary>What should I do instead?</summary>
Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and commit from your local computer. We'll go over code editors next if you don't have one to work on your code locally. You can also use [git on your commandline](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html).

**Task 1: Create a new branch, edit the README.md file with your name, and commit the change on this repository. Then, make a pull request to your main branch and merge the edits!**

Key functions you should be familiar with after this task include:
- Committing changes
- Forking a repository
- Making a new branch
- Making a pull request

**To move on, make sure you commit the change and merge the branch!**
