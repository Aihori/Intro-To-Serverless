## Week 3 Step 3

### Sending the GIF

Now, you're going to connect the Twilio and Giphy APIs! You will send a gif to a user with the Twilio API. You should have the code already written and your Twilio account set up from Week 2.

<details>
<summary>:question: Where is the documentation again?</summary>
  </br>
The documentation is here: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#translate. This link has everything you need to call the Giphy API.

## **:pencil: Task 3: Send the GIF to the User with the Twilio SMS API.** <br>

_Note: Node-fetch must be installed for the code in this step to work! It should already be installed, but you need to require it in the first lines of code._

Once you are done, the function should call the Giphy API and return the data for a gif that matches the dominant emotion from your emotion data.

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: Can I get a more detailed list of steps?</summary>
  </br>
  
1. In the async function, create a new constant that will recieve the dominant emotion from your emotion data (i.e. angry, happy). This dominant emotion should be determined before you call on this trigger function.
2. Using node-fetch, call the translate API endpoint from the Giphy documentation.
3. Run the constant through the string parameter in the endpoint (look as the documentation if this sounds confusing).
4. Declare another constant that formats the results of the API call in json format. Make this constant the output of the function.

Don't forget to have fun with the API â€“ customize your call using the different parameters. Remember to use the gif endpoint and not the sticker endpoint!

## **:camping: To move on, commit your Twilio message as a `.js` file to the root directory of the `week3` branch.**

*Remember: **remove** your Giphy key and Twilio keys before submitting!*
